> IBM Log Analysis (LogDNA) is a tool that provides features to filter, search, define alerts, and design custom log search views to monitor application and system logs on our vaults by collecting logs from the 'audit.log' file for all consul and vault servers per environment.<br>
> This page documents how to create and set up a LogDNA instance for an MZR.<br>
