## - w3 Credentials -
[w3](https://w3.ibm.com/#/) credentials are username and password access into [w3](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/w3/), an IBM internal platform that offers easy-to-access information about the people and tools that drive IBM (like your main dashboard).

* You should have met or have a scheduled meeting to meet with your manager to receive your w3 credentials.

* You can change or reset your temporary w3id Password by clicking [HERE](https://w3.ibm.com/#/support/article/w3id_manage_password/w3id_change_myself).

* Please keep in mind that you will need to be on a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to access any w3 site. There are 2 types of VPNs available that you can use depending on your case needs. (See the section on VPN Setup below to read more about the two types of VPNs.

* When signing into a w3 page, you may be asked for a One Time Passcode while you sign in to your w3 homepage. You, or your manager, will need to update your mobile number in BluePages for this (See the section on BluePages below).

* Watch a demo [HERE](https://secure.video.ibm.com/channel/23354412/video/126459469).


## - YubiKey Setup -
As part of IBM's authentication protocol which requires two methods of validation, each employee who will have access to sensitive information must have a secondary means of verifying their identity. For the Cloud Infrastructure unit, this secondary validation is done by means of a YubiKey device.

* If your manager hasn't already requested one for you, please fill out the [REQUEST FORM](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-cloud-yubikeys) to request for a YubiKey as soon as possible.

* When your YubiKey arrives to your mailing address, activate your key by following the instructions [HERE](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-cloud-yubikeys/enabling-fido). 

* If you need to activate your YubiKey for Softlayer access, follow the instructions [HERE](https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/Yubikey-Setup).

* You will also need to set up a 2-Factor Authentication method, which are credentials that you provide, in addition to your username and password, to securely log in to IBM Cloud. An authentication factor is required only if you or an administrator enables MFA in at least one of the accounts you are a member of. Set up your authentication factors [HERE](https://login.ibm.com/authsvc/mtfim/sps/authsvc?PolicyId=urn:ibm:security:authentication:asf:basicldapuser&Target=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.ibm.com%2Foidc%2Fendpoint%2Fdefault%2Fauthorize%3FqsId%3D8ef00468-0d3f-4fbd-ade9-0c178e66cdc9%26client_id%3DOGY3NzY3YmEtMzNiMi00).
