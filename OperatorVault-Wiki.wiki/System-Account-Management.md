# Vault System Account Management

**Summary**   
All accounts are local to a [GeoRegion](https://github.ibm.com/gensec/OperatorVault-Wiki/wiki/Operator-Vault-Endpoints).   
Temporary or emergency accounts are not allowed. 

**System Accounts**   
Only Vault admins have system level access. Administrative requests must be approved by the individual's manager and the team responsible for the administration of the Vault service. Vault access requests are submitted via SNOW requests.

**Deployment Accounts**   
Only IPOPS staff have access to Vault for the purpose of supporting IBM NG vault production access. Vault access requests are submitted via SNOW requests.. Access requests require approval by the person's Shift Manager in the work notes of the SNOW ticket.

**CBN Process**   
Every Quarter, the Vault CBN process is executed. A CloudLab JIRA issue is assigned to every manager that has one or more employees with Vault access. The manager must comment his/her approval or revocation of access for each of their staff. The CBN process happens over 3 business weeks. The first business day following the 3 weeks accounts are disabled as appropriate. Staff retaining their accounts will have new credentials provided to them using IBM's approved 1Password tool.
