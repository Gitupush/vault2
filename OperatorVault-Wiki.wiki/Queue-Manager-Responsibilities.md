<b>Monitor incoming Jira and CR tickets daily:</b>

* For 'Unassigned' SCMs, assign it to a team member in your respective country (i.e. US Queue Manager to US team member) and post it on the #vault-admin Slack channel. At the end of the day, hand off any incoming ones to the other country's Queue Manager (i.e. US to India; India to US).

* For any blocker CRs, respond directly to the ticket by adding in a comment regarding the ticket's status. (To my team: Is the wording here is correct?)
