## - Workday -
[WORKDAY](https://w3.ibm.com/workday/) is where you can manage your IBM benefits, compensation, tax information, and payroll.

* Go into Workday and select Pay, then Actions and then Payment Elections. Once you submit your direct deposit information, this will trigger your pay stubs to be sent to your IBM email ID. 
 
* You will need your w3 credentials to log in. Normally, a new hire's Workday account will be activated between 8-10 business days from your start date.

* If you need assistance with Workday related issues, contact Workday Help at **wdcoe@ph.ibm.com**.
