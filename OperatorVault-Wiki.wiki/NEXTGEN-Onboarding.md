The Manager and new SecOps team member need to complete steps on [VPC NextGen Onboarding and Offboarding](https://confluence.swg.usma.ibm.com:8445/display/GOD/VPC+NextGen+Onboarding+and+Offboarding) in order to get access to  Jira, Box, and Confluence. Continue reading below for more detailed information and instructions on getting started with access to Vault.

**START HERE for an overview on IBM's [NextGen VPC Infrastructure](https://ibm.ent.box.com/s/qhgmo1ybzz97420vbjgwakyhhoyf778c)**

**Eventually, members will need to work on vault servers across multiple servers (NextGen VPC servers). Familiarize yourself with [Bastions for FSBOA, BNPP, GLOBAL using Global Protect VPN](https://confluence.swg.usma.ibm.com:8445/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=~Peter.Hess&title=Bastions+for+FSBOA%2C+BNPP%2C+GLOBAL+using+GP+VPN#BastionsforFSBOA%2CBNPP%2CGLOBALusingGPVPN-FSBOAaccessprocedure-DAL%2CWDC(assumesGPVPNconnection)). 

**You must first be granted permission to certain requests in order to access the servers. See below for requesting different access types.**

## - Access Hub -
[Access Hub](https://ibm.idaccesshub.com/ECM/) is an access-management tool, for Software as a Service (SaaS) and Heritage applications, that allows you to perform access-related functions for yourself or for other users. Click [HERE](https://confluence.swg.usma.ibm.com:8445/display/JDFC/Using+AccessHub+to+request+user+accounts+for+VPC+NextGen+applications) to see instructions on using Access Hub to request user accounts for VPC NextGen applications.

* Log in using w3 credentials and request an account in JIRA/Confluence. 
* Your Manager is notified by Access Hub by email and is asked to log into Access Hub to approve your account request. 
* When the Manager approves the account, Access Hub automatically creates a new generic account in JIRA for the user and the user is notified. 
* A JIRA admin is also notified, and adds the new user to appropriate user groups.


## - CloudLab -
* Access CloudLab wiki page [HERE](https://confluence.swg.usma.ibm.com:8445/display/CLD/VPC+NextGen+Wiki).

* Request access to CloudLab by following the instructions [HERE](https://confluence.swg.usma.ibm.com:8445/display/ON/Onboarding+Instructions). 

## - JIRA / Confluence -

Anyone requesting access to the CloudLab (NextGen) instances of JIRA and Confluence IDs must submit the request through AccessHub. This process is for requesting new IDs and to reactivate IDs that have been deactivated by AccessHub. You must have a w3 ID to be eligible for a JIRA or Confluence ID. 

**How do I request a JIRA or Confluence ID?**
1. To request access to JIRA/Confluence for yourself: Log into w3. 
2. Go to https://ibm.idaccesshub.com/ECM/workflowmanagement/requesthome (you might need to select the Rubix cube in the upper right and chose Home). 
3. Select Request New Access. 
4. Search for "NextGen (VPC) JIRA/Confluence Software Users" and select Request New Account.
5. On the row, select the Request New Account box. If you see grayed out boxes, you already have an account.
6. Click Select, and then Done. 
7. Check <what shows up here?> and type in a Business Justification. 
8. Select Review & Submit. 


After your request is approved by your manager and a JIRA admin, AccessHub creates your account and you receive notification that your account has been created. You can log in to JIRA.  
> Note: At this point the JIRA admin still needs to add you to the Confluence group and update your name before the account is ready to use. 
> The JIRA admin typically makes these updates at the beginning and end of each day. 
> If you need to be added to additional user groups, contact a JIRA admin.

> _This is an automated process and is handled by the AccessHub team. It does generally take about 24 hours from the time AccessHub requests are approved for access to be granted to the Cloudlab Jira and Confluence workspaces. If you have any questions regarding a request you can check with the #accesshub_ask channel._

**Once you have a JIRA/Confluence ID, you can access them with the following URLs: [JIRA](https://jiracloud.swg.usma.ibm.com:8443/) and [Confluence](https://confluence.swg.usma.ibm.com:8445/)
